# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Settings now says what the panel itself is** — a *This panel* block with its own
  version, its licence, a link to the source, and the line stating that this is an
  independent project. The version is there because the first question on any bug
  report is which one you are running, and until now the panel could only answer for
  the Mountebank it was pointed at.
- **CI** — types, tests, lint and build on Node 20 and 22, plus a smoke test that
  starts the published entry point and proves the panel is served, a write reaches the
  instance through the forward, and the shipped defaults are still injection-off and
  loopback-only.

## 0.1.0 — 18 August 2026

The first release. A visual console for [Mountebank](https://www.mbtest.dev/): its
imposters, their stubs, the responses those stubs give, and the traffic each imposter
captured — none of it hand-written as JSON.

```bash
npx mountebank-studio
```

One command starts a Mountebank, serves the panel and forwards to the instance, so the
panel and the instance share one origin and no `--origin` flag is involved anywhere.

### What it does

- **Imposters** — create, duplicate, delete; ports, protocols, recording, TLS fields,
  a default response, and a raw JSON view of the whole definition.
- **Stubs** — a plain form for method, path, query, headers and body, or the full
  predicate editor with `and`/`or`/`not` groups, `deepEquals`, `exists`, jsonpath
  selectors and case sensitivity. Values carry an explicit JSON type, because
  Mountebank compares by type and a digits-only reference must stay a string.
- **Responses** — canned replies, proxy recording in all three modes, injected
  JavaScript, and **faults** that break the connection instead of answering. Delays,
  behaviors and response cycling included.
- **Traffic** — every request an imposter recorded, with the stub that answered it and
  a drawer explaining why it matched.

### Two things it refuses to do

- **It does not lose what it cannot draw.** Constructs the editor has no field for — a
  proxy's injected headers, a tcp imposter's `mode`, an unknown behavior — are carried
  and written back byte-identically. Round-trip tests assert it.
- **It does not present a guess as a fact.** Mountebank reports which stub answered
  only with `--debug`, so the panel evaluates the predicates itself and labels the
  result as computed. When a read fails, it repeats the request as `no-cors` to tell a
  refused origin apart from a dead host rather than offering a list of maybes.

### Verified against mountebank 2.9.1

Feature by feature, read from the package's own source rather than its documentation:
see [COVERAGE.md](COVERAGE.md).

### Notes

- Apache-2.0.
- Unofficial: not affiliated with or endorsed by the mountebank project. Mountebank is
  MIT-licensed and is not redistributed here — it is a dependency the bundle starts for
  you, bound to loopback with injection off.
